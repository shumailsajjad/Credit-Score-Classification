# Credit-Score-Classification
Applied Machine Learning Project

The Credit Score Classification dataset serves as a valuable resource for machine learning tasks concerning an imbalanced dataset on credit scoring. Our project aimed to implement diverse classification models to categorize individuals into 'Poor,' 'Standard,' and 'Good' credit score classes. Techniques such as stratified sampling and data visualization were employed to facilitate informed financial decision-making.
